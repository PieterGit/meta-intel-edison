## What's new for this release
 1. Removed non-acpi code paths  
    Dropped `acpi` from `DISTRO_FEATURES`. ACPI is now enabled by default for U-Boot, kernel and user space.
    {% include note.html content="Remember that the no-ACPI branch at this point in time is the only one where MRAA and UPM are working. If you are depending on MRAA stick to the sumo32 branch (now frozen). Or better, help us out by fixing MRAA Edison platform support." %}
 2. Linux upgrade to 4.20 and U-Boot to v2018.11
    With 4.20 thanks to the amazing work of Andy Shevchenko and the help of Georgii Staroselskii with 4.20 we now have gadget and OTG support. This means that connecting microUSB 2 (see [Flashing only U-Boot](2.3-Building-and-flashing-U-boot.html#flashing-only-u-boot)) to your desktop USB port allows for a 200Mb/s ethernet-over-USB connection, access to the boot partition and a virtual COM port.
 3. Elimination of hostapd  
    With the possibility of upstream (WAN) connection with ethernet-over-usb (OTG) or through a ethernet USB dongle (device) we can select a secondary (fallback) wifi connection. Or now connman supports that fully, tether the wifi connection, turning Edison into a wifi access point.  
 4. Update the Yocto Thud
